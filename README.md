Hello!! This is Patrisha Ivy S. Gonzales's Website!
This website is inspired by the game Genshin Impact. The purpose of this site is to give the people visiting the site a little information about Genshin!

The information in the website includes:
  Real life references for the places/regions in game
  The different gods/goddesses of each region and element
  The element the region is known for and it's technical mechanics (aka what it does with the ingame combat)

I created the folder during april but only started working on the website in May. I was really busy with other things but after finals, I finally started my site.

This website is drastically different from my prototype however I feel like the output here is better than my first prototype. The theme and intention stayed the same just how I presented it was the key change. 

I searched up youtube videos and used chatgpt to help me code the animations and sync up somethings I needed. All the images used in the site are all official art from the game's social media accounts and in game screenshot.
The font I also used in the site is also the same font in the game itself. I happen to find it online and imported it.

The 4 main pages including navbar layout and adjusting and such, took me a whole day of coding to get it right

The background images used for the pages was slightly edited by me using a drawing app (krita) so that it could luminate more with the gray filter I added in the code.
