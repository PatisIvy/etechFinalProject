              <p class="zhongli-text">Morax, also known as the God of Contracts, goes by many names. He is called Rex Lapis by the people of Liyue but his human name and common name is Zhongli. Rex Lapis retired as Zhongli and now works at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Meanwhile, as Morax, he was also the one who created Mora, the currency used in the game for upgrading characters and the money used in the story. Zhongli, as a playable character, provides the best shield that the game currently offers.

        </h5>
          <p class="liyue2-text">The element “Geo” is a Greek word which means earth/ground. The Geo element in-game is a defensive element as it grants a shield whenever Geo is applied to other elements except Anemo and Dendro. This element is also a supportive element but it is not as used as other elements in the game</p>

          <p class="geo-text">Liyue is known as The Nation of Stone and Contracts, and is inspired by China. The name “Liyue” means Lapis Lazuli or Glass Moon in Chinese. Hoyoverse (the game creators of Genshin), is a company based in China thus Liyue’s representation of China is very precise. An annual in-game event called “Lantern Rite” was hugely based on Chinese New Year. The high mountains are also inspired by Zhangjiajie National Forest Park
